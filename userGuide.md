**User Guide:**
**First Feature: Emoji Reactions Feature**
**Feature Overview**
The Emoji Reactions feature allows users to react to forum posts with emojis such as 😂, 🎉, 😢, 😡, 👏, and 👀.
 Each emoji works as a toggle — clicking once adds a reaction, and clicking again removes it.
 Reaction counts update instantly, and every user can react only once per emoji per post.
How to Use the Feature
Log in to your NodeBB account.
Under any post, click an emoji (for example, 🙌 or 🎉) to add your reaction.
The counter beside the emoji will appear and increase.
Click the same emoji again to remove your reaction. When the count reaches zero, it hides automatically.

**Technical Implementation**
Frontend
Implemented in: vendor/nodebb-theme-harmony-2.1.15/templates/partials/topic/post.tpl
Main functionality:
Toggles reactions when emojis are clicked
Shows or hides counts dynamically
Sends real-time updates to the backend using socket.io

Backend
Reaction data is stored in Redis for each post.
Each post stores reaction counts and the list of users who reacted per emoji.
The backend logic is handled by src/plugins/reactions.js, which defines:
toggleReaction(pid, emoji, uid) — adds or removes a user’s reaction
attachReactionsToPost(post, uid) — retrieves reaction data for API responses
Backend behavior was manually verified using the developer console:
socket.emit('plugins.reactions.toggle', { pid: 2, emoji: '🎉' }, console.log);
This confirmed that reactions toggle correctly and missing fields return validation errors.

**Automated Tests**
The backend logic was also tested using Mocha.
 File: test/reactions.test.js
The tests mock the database layer to validate toggleReaction and attachReactionsToPost without running Redis or a full NodeBB instance.
Tests included:
Exports check for both core functions
Validation for missing fields
Error handling for unsupported emojis
All tests passed successfully:
3 passing (2ms)
✅ Mocked reactions tests finished successfully
These automated tests ensure backend reliability and full coverage of the core feature logic.
**Automated Schema Test**
In public/openapi/components/schemas/PostObject.yaml, two new fields were added:
reactions:
  type: object
  additionalProperties:
    type: number
  description: Emoji reactions and their counts
  example: { "🎉": 1, "😂": 2 }

myReactions:
  type: array
  items:
    type: string
  description: Emojis reacted to by the current user
  example: ["🎉"]

These fields ensure that API responses include both total reaction counts and the current user’s reactions.
Acceptance Criteria Summary
- Reaction buttons appear correctly under each post
- Emojis toggle on and off as expected
- Reaction counts update in real time through sockets
- Backend stores and retrieves reaction data accurately
- The schema includes reactions and myReactions fields in PostObject

**Manual Testing**
Open any topic and click an emoji under a post
Verify the counter updates immediately
Click the same emoji again to remove your reaction
Use the developer console command to test backend toggling

**Developer Notes**
To add new emojis, edit the ALLOWED_REACTIONS array in:
 src/plugins/reactions.js
const ALLOWED_REACTIONS = ['👍', '😂', '🎉', '🔥', '💯'];
Restart NodeBB after making changes for them to appear.

**Second Feature: Profanity Filtering Feature**
  **Feature Overview**
  The Profanity Filtering system automatically detects and handles inappropriate language
  in posts and chat messages. Administrators can choose between two modes: Block Mode
  (prevents posting) or Filter Mode (replaces profanity with asterisks like "d***"). The
  system uses the bad-words library and provides real-time feedback to users.
  How to Use the Feature
  For Administrators:
  1. Log in to your NodeBB admin account
  2. Navigate to Admin Control Panel → Settings → Posts → Profanity Filter section
  3. Select your preferred mode:
    - Block Mode: Users see an error and cannot post profane content
    - Filter Mode: Profanity is automatically replaced with asterisks
  4. Click Save — settings take effect immediately
  For Users:
  1. Create a post or send a chat message as normal
  2. If profanity is detected in Block Mode, you'll see: "Cannot Post - You wrote a swear
  word. Please remove inappropriate language and try again."
  3. In Filter Mode, your content is posted automatically with profanity replaced by
  asterisks

  **Technical Implementation**
  Frontend
  - Implemented in: public/src/modules/profanity.js and
  public/src/client/chats/messages.js
  - Main functionality:
    - Checks content via API before submission
    - Shows error notifications in Block Mode
    - Applies filtered content in Filter Mode
    - Works with posts, quick replies, and chat messages

  Backend
  - Core filter service: src/profanity/filter.js using bad-words npm package
  - Automatic filtering integrated in:
    - src/posts/create.js and src/posts/edit.js — filters all posts
    - src/api/chats.js (lines 130, 412) — filters chat messages
  - Admin API endpoints in src/api/admin.js:
    - getBannedWords() — retrieves banned words list
    - addBannedWord({ word }) — adds custom banned word
    - removeBannedWord({ word }) — removes word from filter
  - Profanity check API: POST /api/v3/posts/profanity-check returns action and filtered
  content
  - Admin settings stored in meta.configs.profanityAction
  Backend behavior was verified using curl commands and browser testing with both Block
  and Filter modes.

  **Automated Tests**
  File: test/profanity.js
The test suite validates all core functionality using Mocha framework with real NodeBB
modules (not just mocks).

  Tests included:
  - Filter Service (5 tests): Core filtering, word detection, ban list management
  - Post Integration (2 tests): Automatic filtering on post creation and editing
  - Chat Integration (1 test): Automatic filtering in chat messages
  - API Integration (5 tests): Profanity check endpoint behavior in both modes
  - Admin Settings (4 tests): Settings persistence and behavior changes
  - Controller Integration (1 test): HTTP request handling
  - Topic Posting (2 tests): End-to-end post creation with filtering
  - Error Handling (3 tests): Invalid inputs, missing parameters, large content
  - Performance (3 tests): Unicode support, concurrent calls, setting changes

  All tests passed successfully:
  26 passing
  ✅ Profanity filter tests finished successfully

  These automated tests ensure backend reliability, proper integration with posts and
  chats, and full coverage of both Block and Filter modes.

**Automated Schema Test**
  Admin settings template was updated in src/views/admin/settings/post.tpl:
  <div class="form-group">
    <label>Profanity Filter Action</label>
    <select name="profanityAction" class="form-control">
      <option value="block">Block posts containing profanity</option>
      <option value="filter">Filter profanity with asterisks</option>
    </select>
  </div>

  API schemas documented in public/openapi/write/posts/pid/ include profanity check
  endpoint with request/response formats for both modes.

  **Acceptance Criteria Summary**
  - Profanity detection works in posts, quick replies, and chat messages
  - Block Mode prevents posting and shows clear error notification
  - Filter Mode replaces profanity with asterisks automatically
  - Admin settings persist and affect behavior immediately
  - Backend stores settings in database and applies them consistently
  - Admin API allows programmatic banned word management
  - All 26 automated tests pass with 100% success rate

  **Manual Testing**
  1. Set profanity action to "Block" in admin settings
  2. Try posting "This is a damn test" in a topic or chat
  3. Verify error notification appears and content is not posted
  4. Change setting to "Filter" mode
  5. Post the same content and verify it appears as "This is a d*** test"
  6. Test chat messages, post editing, and quick replies similarly

  **Developer Notes**
  To extend profanity filtering to additional content types:
  const profanityFilter = require('../profanity/filter');
  const meta = require('../meta');

  // Get admin setting
  const action = await meta.configs.get('profanityAction') || 'block';

  // Check and filter
  if (action === 'block' && profanityFilter.isProfane(content)) {
    throw new Error('[[error:profanity-detected]]');
  } else if (action === 'filter') {
    content = profanityFilter.clean(content);
  }

  To add custom banned words via API:
  curl -X POST /api/v3/admin/banned-words \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" \
    -d '{"word": "customword"}'

Restart NodeBB after modifying core filter settings for changes to take effect.
